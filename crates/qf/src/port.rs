//! Platform / port contract (SRS — QP-specific HAL contract).
//!
//! This module defines the small, framework-level seam that a *port* (the
//! platform runtime glue in `ports/<target>/`) implements so that application
//! code can be written **portably** — generic over the runtime rather than
//! bound to a concrete `PosixQkRuntime`, `CortexMQkRuntime`, … type.
//!
//! Per the QP-specific HAL contract, the only things QP needs from hardware are:
//! 1. **Tick source** — fires at the tick rate to advance the timer wheel
//!    ([`Runtime::tick`]).
//! 2. **Trace output** — a byte-stream sink for QS frames ([`TraceSink`]).
//! 3. **Critical section / interrupt control** — *not* abstracted here: ports
//!    already use the [`critical-section`](https://docs.rs/critical-section)
//!    crate (see `ports/esp32-*/src/interrupts.rs`). Keeping it out of `qf`
//!    leaves the core dependency-free and aligned with the embedded-hal 1.0
//!    ecosystem the HAL was migrated to.
//! 4. **Context switch** — PendSV/SVC on Cortex-M ([`ContextSwitch`]).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use qf::port::Runtime;
//!
//! // Portable application logic — works on any port.
//! fn drive<R: Runtime>(rt: &R) {
//!     rt.tick().ok();
//!     rt.run_until_idle();
//! }
//! ```
